                        As we step into this new year, I find myself reflecting on all the possibilities 
                        that lie ahead. There's something magical about the beginning of a new chapter, 
                        the fresh start that January brings, and the opportunity to set new goals and 
                        aspirations. This year, I'm committed to growth, learning, and making meaningful 
                        connections.

                        The transition into this new year has been both exciting and complicated. 
                        I've spent time thinking about what truly matters to me like my relationships, 
                        my passions, my responsibilities, and the impact I want to make for my family 
                        who has always supported me up until now.

                                    The past months gave me moments I will always cherish.
                                    On January 10, my beloved Tita Beleng finally got married.
                                    All the family efforts paid off, and the celebration was full of joy.
                                    I never thought I would cry at a wedding, but I did.
                                    It felt special seeing a hopeful future begin through a new memory.
                                    We also spent more meaningful time with my auntie.
                                    As we grow older, we understand the value of family connection.
                                    Even when problems arise, gathering together still matters most.
                                    These moments reminded me that shared time is priceless.
                                    I carry these lessons with me as I move into the new year.

                                    Change can be intimidating, but I've learned to see it as a chance to grow.
                                    This year came with challenges, including changes in our living situation.
                                    It wasn't easy, and many family issues surfaced along the way.
                                    While the process was difficult, it was necessary for healing and growth.

                        Despite everything, we stayed connected as a family.
                        Being together, even in small moments, made things feel lighter.
                        We still found reasons to celebrate and smile.
                        In the end, family support made the hardest times more bearable.
                        As I write this first post of the year, I'm filled with optimism and excitement 
                        for what's to come. Here's to new beginnings, endless possibilities, and a year 
                        filled with growth, joy, and meaningful experiences. Thank you for joining me 
                        on this journey!

                            Spending time with my 8-year-old cousin, Karis, has been one of the most enjoyable 
                            moments during these busy times. She helped me with makeup, turning a simple 
                            afternoon into a fun bonding experience. At 19, I felt like a little girl again 
                            under her expert guidance.
                            <br><br>
                            She's the epitome of the little girl I've always wanted to be—open, 
                            embracing her femininity while aspiring to the toughness she sees in her 
                            father. In exchange, I taught her how to play Minecraft, watching her eyes 
                            light up with excitement as she explored virtual worlds.
                            <br><br>
                            These moments remind me of the joy in simple connections and how family 
                            can teach us about ourselves in unexpected ways.

                            Reflecting on meeting my new closest girlies for our 2nd year of college 
                            fills me with immense gratitude. They are the most joyful, smartest, beautiful, 
                            and supportive friends I could ask for. Even though I was content in my own personal 
                            bubble, they showed me the type of connection I never knew I needed.
                            <br><br>
                            During moments of stress and pressure from schoolwork, they were there with 
                            laughter, encouragement, and unwavering support. My first friend was 
                            Jen Raina R. Teodoro, whose energy and kindness drew me in from the start. 
                            Then meeting Joy Anne Ciaris B. Nuqui just made our trio more complete, 
                            with our ridiculous conversations turning even the toughest days into 
                            memorable adventures.
                            <br><br>
                            Together, we've shared late-night study sessions, inside jokes, and dreams 
                            for the future. They taught me that true friendship isn't just about having 
                            fun and growing together in facing these challenges as a team. I'm so 
                            blessed to have them in my life and so on.

                            Reflecting on the special reunion with my GR12 SHS teacher, Ms. Zarina Paredes, 
                            fills me with warmth and gratitude. She treated me with so many thoughtful 
                            gifts—like delicious food, a fun movie outing, a photobooth session, and even 
                            emptying her points because I played too many crane games. The highlight was her 
                            gifting me a purple Labubu bag, which has been incredibly useful ever since.
                            <br><br>
                            Beyond the gifts, she went out of her way to help me navigate back home safely 
                            since I was still new to the streets, not wanting me to risk getting lost. We 
                            had so much fun together, and I never expected to be treated with such kindness 
                            and enjoyment of my company by a teacher. It was truly special.
                            <br><br>
                            I'm grateful that despite not meeting for a long time, we still shared that 
                            same deep connection that helped me achieve so much during my time at 
                            Makati High School. Her support and belief in me made a lasting impact on 
                            my journey.
